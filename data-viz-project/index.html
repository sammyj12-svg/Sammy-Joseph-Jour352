                The NFL published a report spanning the last 10 years. Showing the amount of concussions per year in the
                NFL, including at which point in the season they occured. Charts show where most concussions are
                occuring as well as their frequency in each year.
            </p>
            <p>
                NFL injury data compiled and analyzed by IQVIA, shows an overall decrease in concussions from 2015-2024.
                The league’s ongoing 2025 season is excluded due to partial data.
